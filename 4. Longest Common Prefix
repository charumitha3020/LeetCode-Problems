Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Code:

class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        a=''
        for i in zip(*strs):
            if len(set(i))==1:
                a+=i[0]
            else:
                return a
        return a
